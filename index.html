      <img src="assets/images/img_2439.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Andrew Lakoff">

      <p>I live in the Short Pump area, and am married to Lisa, a surgical nurse at Henrico Doctors,
      and have one beautiful daughter, Lindsey. My daughter is getting married in May of 2019, so
      if anyone wants to start a Go Fund Me page, that would be much appreciated. Oh, almost forgot
      the most special member of our family, Belle. She's a 13 year old English Springer Spaniel.</p>

      <p>Currently, I work at Capital One as a developer and analyst. I am writing scripts using languages
      like Bash, Python, Visual Basic and JavaScript. I am really looking forward to completing
      the Bootcamp and becoming a Full Stack Developer.</p>

      <p>Normally, I don't really like spiders. I do like the University of Richmond Spiders.
      Go Spiders !</p>
